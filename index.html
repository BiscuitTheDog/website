<h1>About this website</h1>
<p>This is my first website, and I will be using this to practice coding.  The topics will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>My dog <strong>Biscuit</strong> </li>
  <img src="images/biscuit.jpg" alt="My doggie" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
  <li>My dog <strong>Scully</strong></li>
  <img src="images/scully.jpg" alt="My other doggie" style="width:500px;height:500px;">
  <li>Whatever else I think of</li>
</ul>
<h2>About <em>Biscuit</em></h2>
<p>Biscuit is a chihuahua and poodle mix.<br>
  She is five years old and enjoys running,<br>
  jumping, eating dentasticks, and taking <br>
  naps under the covers.  She does not like <br>
  wearing sweaters, but she has an adorable<br>
  pink collar with diamonds and her name tag.

<h2>About <em>Scully</em></h2>
<p>Scully is a chihuahua and dashound mix. <br>
  She is four years old and enjoys barking, <br>
  pooping on the carpet, and starting fights<br>
  with larger dogs.  Although she is a constant <br>
  dissapointment to her mother and father, she <br>
  is very loving and enjoys playing with toys and <br>
  wearing sweaters.
