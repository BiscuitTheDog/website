<h2>About <em>Biscuit</em></h2>
<p>Biscuit is a chihuahua and poodle mix.<br>
  She is five years old and enjoys running,<br>
  jumping, eating dentasticks, and taking <br>
  naps under the covers.  She does not like <br>
  wearing sweaters, but she has an adorable<br>
  pink collar with diamonds and her name tag.<br>
  <br>
  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biscuit" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> for a more detailed discussion of <strong>Biscuit</strong>.

<h2>About <em>Scully</em></h2>
<p>Scully is a chihuahua and dashound mix. <br>
  She is four years old and enjoys barking, <br>
  pooping on the carpet, and starting fights<br>
